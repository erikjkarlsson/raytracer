# raytracer

Experimental 2.5 dimensional raytracer written in C++ using SFML.

## Prerequisites:
  - UNIX (optional)
  - libsfml (sfml2 library)
  - GNU-make
  - c++ compiler
  - chrono library
  - boost library


## How to run
If you are running a GNU system u can use GNUmake to compile the files (makefile provided).
However the bash script run_game.sh will compile (from scratch) and run the game automatically.
\# bash run_game.sh

If using Microsoft Windows, the game can be manually compiled or compiled under Cygwin.
Im not running Windows, so instructions are not provided.
